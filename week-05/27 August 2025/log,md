### 🧩 Project / Lab Title:
**Create a Secure Data Lake on Cloud Storage: Challenge Lab**

📆 Date Completed:  
**August 27, 2025**

🔍 Objective:  
To apply and integrate the knowledge of Cloud IAM, Cloud Storage, and Dataplex in a hands-on scenario without step-by-step instructions. The goal was to build a secure and well-governed data lake structure based on a set of requirements, proving my ability to solve a real-world problem.

🔧 Tools/Services Used:
- Cloud IAM
- Cloud Storage (including Bucket Lock)
- Dataplex
- Google Cloud Console

🧠 What I Did:
- This was a **Challenge Lab**, so I was given a scenario and a list of objectives to achieve on my own.
- I translated the requirements into a series of actions:
  1.  **Storage:** Created multiple Cloud Storage buckets to represent different stages of a data lake (e.g., for raw and processed data).
  2.  **Security & Compliance:** Applied a **retention policy** (Bucket Lock) to the raw data bucket to meet a specified data immutability requirement.
  3.  **Access Control:** Configured fine-grained **IAM policies** to enforce the Principle of Least Privilege, granting different levels of access (e.g., write vs. read-only) to different users/roles for the respective buckets.
  4.  **Governance:** Set up a **Dataplex Lake** and created distinct **Zones** (e.g., `raw-zone`, `curated-zone`) within it.
  5.  **Integration:** **Attached the Cloud Storage buckets as Assets** to their corresponding zones in Dataplex, bringing the entire infrastructure under a unified data governance fabric.
- I independently troubleshot my configurations until all tasks were successfully validated by the automated scoring system.

🛡️ GRC / Compliance Relevance:  
✅ Critical  
This lab is the ultimate test of applying GRC principles in practice.
- **Implementation of Controls:** Instead of just learning about individual controls, this lab required me to implement a cohesive *system of controls* (access, retention, governance) to meet a specific compliance scenario.
- **Security Posture Validation:** The challenge lab format simulates a real-world audit or validation test. The automated checker acts as a compliance officer, verifying that the deployed infrastructure correctly enforces the required security posture.
- **End-to-End Data Governance:** The task involved securing the entire data lifecycle within the lake—from raw data retention to governed access in a structured zone. This demonstrates a mature understanding of data governance.

🚩 Risks Identified:  
- **Misinterpretation of Requirements:** In a challenge lab, the main risk is misunderstanding the scenario's objectives, which can lead to building a solution that is functional but does not meet the specific security or compliance requirements.
- **Integration Errors:** The challenge lies in making multiple services work together seamlessly. A small error in an IAM policy could prevent Dataplex from accessing an asset, causing the entire setup to fail validation.

✅ What I Learned:
- This lab solidified my ability to translate a set of business and security requirements into a functional cloud architecture.
- I gained practical experience in integrating **IAM**, **Cloud Storage retention policies**, and **Dataplex** to build a single, secure solution.
- It significantly improved my problem-solving skills, as I had to rely on my own knowledge to diagnose and fix configuration issues without guidance.
- It provided a powerful, hands-on validation of my ability to apply the Principle of Least Privilege and data governance concepts in a realistic context.

💭 Reflection:  
This challenge lab was the perfect capstone for the quest. It was a true test of whether I had actually absorbed the knowledge from the previous labs or was just following steps. Designing the solution from scratch based only on a set of goals felt like a genuine real-world task. It was incredibly rewarding to see the individual components—IAM, Storage, Dataplex—come together as a cohesive system and pass all the checks. This experience gave me a huge confidence boost in my ability to apply these critical data security principles in practice.
