### 🧩 Project / Lab Title:
**Web Security Scanner: Qwik Start**

📆 Date Completed:  
**July 31, 2025**

🔍 Objective:  
To learn how to use the built-in Web Security Scanner service to perform a dynamic vulnerability scan on a live web application deployed on Google App Engine.

🔧 Tools/Services Used:
- Web Security Scanner
- Security Command Center
- App Engine
- Cloud Shell
- Python (Flask)

🧠 What I Did:
- Cloned a sample Python Flask "Hello World" application into my Cloud Shell environment.
- Modified the application's dependencies to ensure it was compatible with the latest environment.
- Deployed the application to the **App Engine Standard Environment** using the `gcloud app deploy` command.
- Verified the application was live by accessing its public `appspot.com` URL.
- Navigated to the Security Command Center section of the console and enabled the **Web Security Scanner API**.
- Created a new scan configuration, providing the public URL of my deployed App Engine application as the starting point.
- Initiated the scan and monitored its progress until completion.
- Reviewed the results, which, for this simple application, correctly reported no vulnerabilities found.

🛡️ GRC / Compliance Relevance:  
✅ High  
This lab directly addresses a core GRC requirement: vulnerability management.
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Most compliance frameworks (PCI-DSS, SOC 2, ISO 27001) mandate regular vulnerability scanning of applications. Web Security Scanner is a tool that helps automate and fulfill this requirement.
- **Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC):** Integrating automated security scanning is a key practice in a mature SSDLC. This lab demonstrates how to perform security testing on a deployed application, which is a critical step before or shortly after a production release.
- **Risk Management & Auditing:** The reports generated by the scanner serve as evidence for auditors and provide data for internal risk assessments, demonstrating due diligence in securing web applications.

🚩 Risks Identified:  
- **False Sense of Security:** The scanner explicitly states that it errs on the side of under-reporting to avoid false positives. A "clean" scan does not guarantee an application is free from all flaws. Relying solely on automated tools without manual code review or penetration testing is a significant risk.
- **Incomplete Scan Coverage:** If an application has complex user flows, pages behind logins, or dynamically generated content that the scanner cannot discover, critical parts of the application may go unscanned.
- **Potential Production Impact:** While designed to be safe, running any automated scanner against a live production environment always carries a small risk of causing unexpected load or behavior.

✅ What I Learned:
- **Web Security Scanner** is a managed dynamic application security testing (DAST) tool integrated into Google Cloud.
- It can scan applications hosted on **App Engine**, **GKE**, and **Compute Engine**.
- The scanner works by crawling a web application from a starting URL, following links, and testing inputs for common vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), use of insecure libraries, and mixed content.
- To use the scanner, the target application must first be deployed and accessible via a public URL.
- The service is part of the broader **Security Command Center**, which provides a centralized view of security posture in Google Cloud.

💭 Reflection:  
This lab was an excellent look at the "Sec" in "DevSecOps." It shifted the focus from building and deploying to actively probing for weaknesses. It's powerful to have an automated security tool built right into the platform, making it easy to run basic security checks. This experience really highlights the importance of a layered security approach; while the scanner is a great first line of defense for finding common issues, it's also clear that it's just one piece of a much larger security puzzle that includes secure coding practices, IAM policies, and manual expert reviews.
