### 🧩 Project / Lab Title:
**Skills Boost Arcade Trivia July 2025 Week 2 (Quiz)**

📆 Date Completed:  
**August 2, 2025**

🔍 Objective:  
To validate and reinforce the knowledge acquired from the hands-on labs completed during the "Trivia Week 2" game by successfully passing a multiple-choice quiz.

🔧 Tools/Services Used:
- Google Cloud Skills Boost Platform

🧠 What I Did:
- As the final activity for the "Trivia Week 2" game, I started the quiz lab.
- I answered a series of multiple-choice questions that tested my understanding of the concepts covered in the week's labs, such as Log Analytics and Security Command Center.
- I achieved a passing score of 60%, successfully completing the requirement.
- By finishing this quiz, I completed all necessary activities for the "Trivia Week 2" game and earned the corresponding badge.

🛡️ GRC / Compliance Relevance:  
✅ Low  
While not a direct operational control, this activity relates to GRC through:
- **Competency Verification:** In a corporate setting, quizzes are used to verify that personnel have completed and understood mandatory training (e.g., annual security awareness), which is often an audit requirement.
- **Knowledge Reinforcement:** The quiz reinforces best practices related to security monitoring and log analysis, which are critical GRC-related skills.

🚩 Risks Identified:  
- **Knowledge Gaps:** A passing score, especially a low one, may still indicate potential gaps in understanding. In a real-world scenario, these knowledge gaps could lead to misconfiguration or failure to properly utilize security tools.

✅ What I Learned:
- This quiz served as an effective capstone to consolidate the practical knowledge gained from the week's labs.
- It tested my recall of key features and the purpose of services like Log Analytics and Security Command Center.
- It emphasized the importance of understanding the "why" behind the hands-on steps, not just how to follow them.

💭 Reflection:  
Finishing the week with a quiz was a good way to check my understanding. It’s a simple but effective method to ensure the key concepts from the labs have stuck with me. It solidifies the learning process, connecting the hands-on experience with theoretical knowledge. Completing this final step to earn the weekly badge provides a satisfying sense of accomplishment.
