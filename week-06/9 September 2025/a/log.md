### üß© Project / Lab Title:
**Develop No-Code Chat Apps with AppSheet**

üìÜ Date Completed:¬†¬†
**September 9, 2025**

üîç Objective:¬†¬†
To learn how to build a no-code application using AppSheet and integrate it with Google Chat, enabling users to interact with the app's features directly from the chat interface through slash commands and automated notifications.

üîß Tools/Services Used:
- AppSheet
- Google Chat
- Google Sheets (as a data source)

üß† What I Did:
- Started with a pre-built **AppSheet** app for managing ATM maintenance, which used a **Google Sheet** as its database.
- In the AppSheet editor, I added and configured a **Chat component** to enable integration with Google Chat.
- I created custom **slash commands** (e.g., `/report`, `/status`) that allow users to trigger specific app functions, like creating a new issue or querying data, directly from the Google Chat message bar.
- I built an **automation** within AppSheet to act as a bot. This automation was configured to proactively send a notification to a Google Chat space whenever a specific event occurred in the app (like a new high-priority issue being logged).
- After publishing the app, I tested the complete workflow in Google Chat, successfully using the slash commands and observing the automated notifications.

üõ°Ô∏è GRC / Compliance Relevance:¬†¬†
‚úÖ Moderate¬†¬†
While no-code platforms accelerate development, they introduce unique GRC challenges.
- **Citizen Development Governance:** AppSheet enables "citizen developers" to create apps. A strong GRC program must have policies to govern these apps, ensuring they are secure, documented, and don't create "shadow IT" risks.
- **Data Governance & Access Control:** The app interacts with data stored in a Google Sheet. It is critical to manage the sharing permissions of the underlying sheet and the user access controls within the AppSheet app to prevent unauthorized data access or modification.
- **Audit Trail:** Both AppSheet and Google Chat generate logs. These logs can be used to audit who performed what actions through the chat app, providing an important trail for operational accountability.

üö© Risks Identified:¬†¬†
- **Data Leakage:** The most significant risk is an improperly secured data source. If the backend Google Sheet is made public, sensitive operational data could be exposed, bypassing any security within the AppSheet app itself.
- **Flawed Business Logic:** In a no-code environment, it can be easy to create automations with incorrect logic (e.g., notifying the wrong people, not validating data). This can lead to real-world operational errors.
- **"Shadow IT" Proliferation:** The ease of app creation can lead to many business-critical but unmanaged and unsupported applications. If the original creator leaves the company, these apps can become a significant operational risk.

‚úÖ What I Learned:
- **AppSheet** is a powerful no-code platform for building data-driven applications, using sources like **Google Sheets**.
- AppSheet apps can be deeply integrated into **Google Chat**, allowing users to interact with them "in-context" where they work.
- **Slash commands** are the primary mechanism for users to invoke app functions from within Chat.
- **Automations** in AppSheet enable the app to act like a bot, proactively sending event-driven notifications and data to Chat spaces.

üí≠ Reflection:¬†¬†
This lab was a fascinating look at the power of no-code platforms and their integration into collaborative workspaces. It's truly impressive how a complex, interactive application that solves a real business need can be built and deployed without writing any code. Integrating the app into Google Chat is a game-changer, as it meets users where they are instead of forcing them to open yet another application. This is a powerful demonstration of the "citizen developer" movement, empowering teams to rapidly build their own tools to improve their workflows.
