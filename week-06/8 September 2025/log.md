### üß© Project / Lab Title:
**Looker Studio: Qwik Start**

üìÜ Date Completed:¬†¬†
**September 8, 2025**

üîç Objective:¬†¬†
To learn the fundamental workflow of Looker Studio by connecting to a public BigQuery dataset, creating a report, visualizing the data with a chart, and applying styles to create a polished and easy-to-understand dashboard.

üîß Tools/Services Used:
- Looker Studio
- BigQuery (as a data source)
- Google Cloud Console

üß† What I Did:
- I started a new report in **Looker Studio**.
- I used the built-in **BigQuery connector** to connect to a public dataset provided by the lab.
- After selecting a specific table, this data source was added to my report, making all its fields (dimensions and metrics) available for use.
- I added a new chart (e.g., a bar chart or time series) to the report canvas.
- I configured the chart by dragging and dropping appropriate **dimensions** (like a date or category) and **metrics** (like a record count or a sum) into the chart's setup panel.
- Finally, I used the **style panel** to customize the report's aesthetics, changing colors, fonts, and labels to improve readability and visual appeal.

üõ°Ô∏è GRC / Compliance Relevance:¬†¬†
‚úÖ Moderate¬†¬†
Looker Studio is a key tool for GRC reporting and visibility, although it's not a direct security control itself.
- **Compliance Reporting:** It is an essential tool for building dashboards that visualize GRC metrics, such as security findings from Security Command Center, audit log events, or IAM policy assignments. This makes complex data accessible to stakeholders and auditors.
- **Data Governance through Access Control:** Looker Studio respects the IAM permissions of the underlying data source. A user cannot visualize data from a BigQuery table in Looker Studio unless they have the required permissions on that table, thus enforcing data access governance.
- **Accurate Information Presentation:** A core part of governance is ensuring that data is presented accurately to decision-makers. Well-designed dashboards prevent the misinterpretation of critical security or operational data.

üö© Risks Identified:¬†¬†
- **Inadvertent Data Exposure:** The primary risk is misconfiguring the sharing settings of a report (e.g., sharing "publicly" instead of "domain-only"), which could expose the report's visuals to unintended audiences.
- **Misleading Visualizations:** A poorly constructed chart (e.g., a truncated Y-axis on a bar chart) can be misleading and lead to incorrect conclusions, which is a significant risk if the dashboard is used for critical business or security decisions.
- **Performance and Cost:** Connecting a report directly to massive, unoptimized tables in BigQuery can result in slow-loading dashboards and high query costs. Data should be properly modeled and aggregated in BigQuery first.

‚úÖ What I Learned:
- **Looker Studio** is a powerful, free, web-based tool for creating interactive reports and dashboards.
- It connects to a wide variety of data sources using built-in **connectors**, with BigQuery being a primary one.
- The fundamental workflow is **Connect -> Visualize -> Style**.
- Reports are built by assigning **dimensions** (the "what," e.g., 'Product Category') and **metrics** (the "how much," e.g., 'Sales') to charts.
- The platform provides rich styling options to create professional-looking and effective data visualizations.

üí≠ Reflection:¬†¬†
This lab was a great introduction to the art of turning raw data into an insightful story. It's incredibly satisfying to see how quickly you can go from a massive table of data in BigQuery to a clean, interactive dashboard. Looker Studio feels very intuitive and makes data visualization accessible to everyone, not just data analysts. I can immediately see how this would be my go-to tool for creating project status dashboards, monitoring application metrics, or building reports for stakeholders. It effectively democratizes business intelligence.
