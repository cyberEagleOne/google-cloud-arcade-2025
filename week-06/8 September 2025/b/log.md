### üß© Project / Lab Title:
**Explore and Create Reports with Looker Studio**

üìÜ Date Completed:¬†¬†
**September 8, 2025**

üîç Objective:¬†¬†
To build a comprehensive, multi-element report in Looker Studio by connecting to a real-world e-commerce dataset in BigQuery, exploring its schema, and creating various visualizations to derive business insights.

üîß Tools/Services Used:
- Looker Studio
- BigQuery (Google Analytics Public Dataset)

üß† What I Did:
- Created a new report in **Looker Studio** and connected it to the `google_analytics_sample` public dataset in **BigQuery**.
- Explored the rich, nested schema of the e-commerce data directly within the Looker Studio interface to identify key dimensions and metrics.
- Built a dashboard-style report with multiple visualizations on a single canvas, including:
  - **Scorecards** to display high-level Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
  - A **Time Series Chart** to visualize user traffic over a date range.
  - A **Geo Map** to show the geographic distribution of users.
  - A **Bar Chart** to compare top traffic sources.
- I customized the report's layout, added a title and descriptive text, and styled the elements to create a cohesive and visually appealing data story.

üõ°Ô∏è GRC / Compliance Relevance:¬†¬†
‚úÖ Moderate¬†¬†
Building reports on sensitive datasets like e-commerce analytics requires careful governance.
- **Data Governance through Access Control:** Looker Studio enforces the IAM permissions of the underlying BigQuery data source. This is a critical control that ensures users can only visualize data they are explicitly authorized to access.
- **Role-Based Reporting:** The ability to create different reports for different audiences (e.g., a marketing summary vs. a detailed transaction log report) aligns with the GRC principle of providing information on a "need-to-know" basis.
- **Auditable Insights:** The dashboards created can serve as an audit trail for business decisions and demonstrate that the organization is actively monitoring key metrics and activities.

üö© Risks Identified:¬†¬†
- **PII Exposure:** E-commerce datasets can contain potential Personally Identifiable Information (e.g., `fullVisitorId`). Visualizing this data without proper aggregation or anonymization could lead to privacy violations if the report is shared improperly.
- **Incorrect Data Interpretation:** Creating visualizations from complex, nested datasets requires a deep understanding of the data schema. Incorrectly configured joins or filters can lead to misleading charts and poor business decisions.
- **Data Freshness:** Dashboards can be configured with different data freshness settings. Users must be aware of how up-to-date the data is to avoid making decisions based on stale information.

‚úÖ What I Learned:
- How to connect Looker Studio to the complex, nested data structures found in the **Google Analytics BigQuery dataset**.
- The practical use of various chart types to answer specific business questions, such as using **Scorecards** for KPIs and **Geo Maps** for location analysis.
- The process of designing and composing a multi-element **dashboard** to tell a comprehensive data story, rather than just creating isolated charts.
- How to apply styling and layout options to transform raw visualizations into a polished, professional report.

üí≠ Reflection:¬†¬†
This lab was a fantastic real-world application of the skills from the "Qwik Start". Working with a rich e-commerce dataset made the process much more tangible and exciting. It felt like I was a data analyst for the Google Merchandise Store, uncovering insights from millions of records with just a few clicks. It's truly powerful how Looker Studio can take a complex BigQuery table and make it so easy to explore and understand visually. This is a skill I can immediately use to analyze and present any dataset in a meaningful way.
