### üß© Project / Lab Title:
**A Tour of Cloud Networking**

üìÜ Date Completed:¬†¬†
**August 10, 2025**

üîç Objective:¬†¬†
To gain a high-level, conceptual understanding of Google Cloud's comprehensive networking services by learning about the six core building blocks of cloud networking.

üîß Tools/Services Used:
- Google Cloud Skills Boost Platform (Informational Lab)

üß† What I Did:
- This lab was a conceptual tour rather than a hands-on exercise. I read through the provided materials to understand Google's networking philosophy.
- I learned about the six fundamental building blocks that Google uses to categorize its networking services: Network Connectivity, Network Security, Service Networking, Service Security, Content Delivery, and Observability.
- This provided a mental framework for how different services like VPCs, Cloud Armor, and Load Balancers fit into a cohesive whole.

üõ°Ô∏è GRC / Compliance Relevance:¬†¬†
‚úÖ High¬†¬†
A solid understanding of network architecture is a prerequisite for building any secure and compliant cloud environment.
- **Network Security & Segmentation:** Concepts like VPCs, Firewall Rules, and Cloud Armor are the primary tools for isolating workloads and protecting against external threats, which are core GRC requirements.
- **Secure Connectivity:** Understanding how to securely connect on-premises data centers to the cloud (via Cloud VPN or Interconnect) is critical for hybrid-cloud compliance strategies.
- **Audit & Monitoring:** The observability pillar, which includes tools like Network Intelligence Center, is essential for security monitoring, traffic logging, and incident response, all of which are subject to audit.

üö© Risks Identified:¬†¬†
- **Conceptual vs. Practical Gap:** The primary risk from a purely informational lab is gaining theoretical knowledge without the hands-on skill to implement it securely. A misconfigured VPC or firewall rule remains a significant security risk, regardless of conceptual understanding.

‚úÖ What I Learned:
- Google Cloud's networking services can be understood through six building blocks:
  1.  **Network Connectivity:** Connecting your networks (e.g., Cloud VPN, Interconnect).
  2.  **Network Security:** Protecting your networks (e.g., Cloud Armor, Cloud Firewall).
  3.  **Service Networking:** Publishing and connecting services (e.g., Load Balancing, Private Service Connect).
  4.  **Service Security:** Securing your services (e.g., IAP, mTLS).
  5.  **Content Delivery:** Accelerating content delivery (e.g., Cloud CDN).
  6.  **Observability:** Monitoring and troubleshooting (e.g., Network Intelligence Center).
- I also learned about **Network Service Tiers** (Premium vs. Standard), which determines how traffic is routed over Google's global backbone versus the public internet.

üí≠ Reflection:¬†¬†
This lab was like being given a map of a large city. Before, I knew how to get to a few places (like Compute Engine or Cloud Storage), but now I understand how all the roads and highways connect. The "six building blocks" framework is incredibly helpful for organizing the vast array of networking services and understanding their purpose. It provides a solid foundation for designing secure, scalable, and cost-effective network architectures on GCP.
