### 🧩 Project / Lab Title:
**Skills Boost Arcade Trivia July 2025 Week 1 – Quiz Completion**

📆 Date Completed:  
**July 26, 2025**

🔍 Objective:  
To complete the weekly trivia quiz testing knowledge across multiple Google Cloud products, including APIs and data platforms such as Looker and Document AI.

🔧 Tools/Services Used:
- Google Cloud Arcade
- Cloud Natural Language API
- Document AI
- Looker

🧠 What I Did:
- Answered the quiz questions related to APIs like Natural Language and Document AI
- Reviewed technical features such as `analyzeEntitySentiment` and merged results in Looker
- Successfully passed the full quiz and earned the Trivia Week 1 badge

🛡️ GRC / Compliance Relevance:  
✅ High  
Understanding data classification, document processing, and NLP APIs is essential in compliance and governance contexts, such as:
- Redacting sensitive data (PII)
- Structuring unstructured inputs (PDFs, emails)
- Automating data tagging and sentiment classification

🚩 Risks Identified:  
None — content is based on knowledge validation, no live environment or code used.

✅ What I Learned:
- **Natural Language API** lets you analyze syntax, entities, and sentiment in text  
- The method `analyzeEntitySentiment` provides sentiment scores per entity  
- **Document AI API** processes unstructured documents using a processor as a bridge  
- **Looker’s Merged Results** feature lets you combine different Explores for unified visualizations  
- Merge Rules automatically determine how dimensions are matched across datasets

💭 Reflection:  
Even though it was a quiz, I felt like this was a recap of everything I had touched this week — APIs, structured data, and visualization concepts. It's helping me remember and apply concepts better. Excited to take on the Week 2 challenge!
