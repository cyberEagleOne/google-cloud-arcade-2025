### 🧩 Project / Lab Title:
**Merging Results from Different Explores in Looker**

🔍 Objective:  
To use Looker for analyzing datasets across two sources (Flights & Airports), merge them, and create a live dashboard.

🔧 Tools/Services Used:
- Looker BI
- Flights + Airports Explore
- Merge Results, Filters, Visualization

🧠 What I Did:
- Created a primary query from `Flights` dataset
- Filtered by year 2000 and selected key fields
- Merged with `Airports` dataset using `City` field
- Built a visual table, sorted by elevation
- Added destination city to the primary query
- Saved result to a new dashboard: `Airport Data`

🛡️ GRC / Compliance Relevance:
✅ High  
Visual analytics is critical for GRC monitoring — merging structured data into interactive dashboards is a game-changer.

🚩 Risks Identified:  
Merging data incorrectly could mislead stakeholders (e.g. bad match keys).

✅ What I Learned:
- How BI tools support real-time compliance reporting
- Power of merging data visually without SQL
- Creating dashboards for reuse

💭 Reflection:  
I never thought BI tools could make working with data this simple. It was amazing to visually merge and explore data. Feels like the kind of tool a GRC Analyst or Compliance Engineer would love.
If you ever had an experience in mySQL than you'll get a basic understanding in what this web capable to do.
